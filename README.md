# HybridA-Demo

This repository is a demonstration of Hybrid A*, a famous robot motion planning algorithm. Hybrid A* combines the benefits of grid-based and graph-based algorithms to efficiently navigate a robot in a continuous environment with obstacles.

## Features

- Implementation of the Hybrid A* algorithm
- Visualization of the robot's path in a 2D grid environment
- Integration with various robot simulators for real-time testing
- Documentation and examples to help understand and use the algorithm

## Getting Started
